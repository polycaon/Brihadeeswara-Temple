          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Built entirely of granite, the temple utilized over 130,000 tons of the stone, transported from quarries over 60 kilometers away. This massive logistical operation was accomplished without modern equipment, using only manpower, elephants, and wooden rollers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The most remarkable aspect of the temple's construction is that it was built without the use of mortar. The granite blocks are precisely cut and fitted together using an interlocking system, demonstrating the advanced engineering knowledge of the era.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            The temple's foundation is built on a solid granite base that rises 5 feet above ground level, providing a sturdy platform for the massive structure. Despite standing for over a millennium and experiencing numerous earthquakes, the temple has remained structurally sound.

              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The central tower or vimana of Brihadeeswara Temple rises to a height of 216 feet (66 meters), making it one of the tallest temple towers in India. The thirteen-tiered pyramidal structure is topped with a massive monolithic cupola (kumbam) that weighs approximately 80 tons.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that the engineers had to devise a way to lift this massive stone to the top of the tower without modern equipment. It is believed that they used a specially constructed 6.44 km (4 mile) long ramp to gradually move the stone to its position.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                The vimana is designed to cast no shadow at noon during the equinoxes, showcasing the precision of ancient Tamil astronomy and architectural planning.

              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Facing the main shrine is a pavilion housing a monolithic statue of Nandi, the sacred bull that serves as Lord Shiva's vahana (vehicle). The statue is carved from a single block of granite and measures approximately 6 meters long and 3.7 meters high.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The Nandi statue is positioned directly in line with the sanctum sanctorum, symbolically gazing eternally at Lord Shiva. This alignment is a common feature in Shiva temples, but the scale and craftsmanship of the Brihadeeswara Nandi are exceptional.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                The statue is known for its perfect proportions and fine details, showcasing the skill of Chola sculptors. Every evening, the Nandi is ritually anointed with oil, helping to preserve the stone and maintain its polished appearance over the centuries.

              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The heart of the temple is the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum, which houses a massive Lingam (the aniconic representation of Lord Shiva). The Lingam is approximately 12 feet tall and is one of the largest in India.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The sanctum is designed in accordance with ancient Agamic texts, with perfect proportions that are believed to create a powerful spiritual energy. The space is relatively austere compared to the elaborate exterior, focusing attention on the deity.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                The inner walls of the sanctum were originally adorned with frescoes, though many have deteriorated over time. The few that remain provide valuable insights into Chola-era painting techniques and iconography.

              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The temple complex is surrounded by two concentric rectangular enclosures (prakarams) with massive walls. These enclosures are entered through ornate gateways known as gopurams.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Unlike later Tamil temples where the gopurams are taller than the central vimana, at Brihadeeswara, the vimana remains the tallest structure, emphasizing the primacy of the main shrine. This architectural hierarchy is characteristic of early Chola temple design.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                The outer prakaram houses numerous sub-shrines dedicated to various deities, including the Pancha Lingams (five lingams representing the five elements), Subrahmanya, Ganapati, and the Ashta-dikpaalakas (eight guardians of the directions).

                The temple features sculptures depicting 108 karanas (dance poses) from the Natya Shastra, India's ancient text on performing arts. These are the earliest known sculptural representations of these classical dance positions.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The walls of Brihadeeswara Temple contain over 400 inscriptions in Tamil and Grantha scripts, dating from the Chola period to later dynasties. These inscriptions serve as invaluable historical records.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">

              <li>The king's military victories and territorial conquests</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              These inscriptions have been crucial for historians in reconstructing the political, economic, social, and cultural life of the Chola period, making the temple not just a religious monument but also a historical archive.

              The inner walls of the temple were once adorned with elaborate frescoes painted in the Chola style. Though many have been lost to time, some remain visible, particularly in the circumambulatory passage around the sanctum.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              The surviving murals depict:
